# Sample Player Setup
Link binary with libraries: AudioToolbox and AVFoundation

If using an EXS instrument, the sound files must be in a folder called "EXS Factory Samples".

This project includes a simple UI with buttons that play seven different notes from the sampler. MIDI sequences can also be played by the loaded instrument.

# Testing
There are simple tests that load a SoundFont, an EXS instrument and a MIDI sequence.
