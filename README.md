# Sample Player Setup
Link binary with libraries: AudioToolbox and AVFoundation

If using an EXS instrument, the sound files must be in a folder called "EXS Factory Samples".

This project includes a simple UI with buttons that play seven different notes from the sampler.

# Testing
There are simple tests that load a SoundFont and an EXS instrument.
